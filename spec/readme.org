* /Hush/
  /Hush/ is a /Unix/ shell scripting language inspired by the /[[http://www.lua.org/][Lua/ programming
  language]]. Currently in development.

  This is the technical specification for /Hush/, defining the complete syntax and semantics
  of the language.
** Foreword
   /Hush/ is motivated by some shortcomings in traditional shell languages, mainly the lack
   of appropriate primitive data structures, such as generic arrays and maps. Such
   shortcomings result in hacky workarounds for simple tasks, and render complicated tasks
   being rather tricky to implement.

   /Hush/ borrows a great part of it's design from /Lua/, a simple but elegant scripting
   language. /Lua/ has proved to be a very expressive programming language, regardless of
   it's succinct syntax and semantics, particularly it's very simple type system.
** Type system
   As in /Lua/, /Hush/ proposes a handful of built-in types, and no user-defined types. This
   makes the type system extremely simple, without compromising expressiveness. The types
   proposed by /Hush/ are:
   - =nil=: the unit type, usually for representing missing values.
   - =bool=: the boolean type.
   - =int=: a 64 bit integer type.
   - =float=: a 64 bit floating point type.
   - =char=: a C-like unsigned char type, 0-255.
   - =string=: a char-array like string.
   - =array=: a heterogeneous array, 0-indexed unlike in /Lua/.
   - =dict=: a heterogeneous hash map.
   - =function=: a callable function.
   - =error=: a special error type, to ease distinction of errors from other values. This
     type can only be instantianted by the built-in =error= function. For more details, see
     the [[#Errors][errors]] section.

   All types except the ~array~ and ~dict~ are immutable. This means that, for instance, when
   one increments a integer, a new value is created with the result.
** Syntax
   As /Hush/ is heavily inspired by /Lua/, it borrows most of the syntax from it, with only
   minor tweaks to support the additional command invocation syntax.
*** Identifiers
    Identifiers in /Hush/ are case sensitive, composed by alphanumeric or underscore
    characters, and must not start with a number. The only exception is the keywords,
    which are not valid identifiers.
*** Keywords
    The following are keywords in /Hush/:
    : let, if, then, else, end, for, in, do, while, function, return, not, and, or, true, false, nil, break, self
*** Literals
    Each type in the language, except for the =error= type, has corresponding syntax for
    literals:
    - =nil=: It's only value is ~nil~.
    - =bool=: ~true~ and ~false~.
    - =int=: 64 bit decimal integer literal, optionally prefixed by a minus sign.
    - =float=: 64 bit floating point literal: a decimal followed by a period character,
      followed by another decimal literal, with an optional exponent.
    - =char=: a single char enclosed in single quotes.
    - =string=: string literal enclosed in double quotes.
    - =array=: values enclosed in =[]=, separated by commas.
    - =dict=: identifier-expression pairs enclosed in =@[]=, separated by a colon and
      delimited by commas.
    - =function=:
      : function (<args>)
      :   <body>
      : end

    Example:
    #+begin_src bash
      let my_dict = @[ # dict
        field0: nil,
        field1: true,
        field2: 42, # integer
        field3: -12, # integer
        field4: 3.14, # float
        field5: 12E+99, # float
        field6: [ # array
          "a simple string",
          "a string with \n escaped \" charaters",
          'c', # a char
          '\n' # another char
        ],
        field7: function (arg1, arg2)
          return arg1 + arg2
        end
      ]
    #+end_src
*** Comments
    Comments can be placed in any point of a line, starting with =#= and spanning until the
    end of the line.
*** Operators
    /Hush/ provides the following operators, in order of precedence:
    - Unary:
      + Logical: =not= (prefix).
      + Arithmetic: =-= (prefix).
      + Field access: =.=, =[]= (postfix).
    - Binary:
      + Arithmetic: =*=, =/=, =%=, =+=, =-=.
      + String: =++= (right associative).
      + Relational: =>=, =<=, =>==, =<==.
      + Equality: ====, =!==.
      + Logical: =and=, =or=.
      + Assignment: ===.

    Regarding semantics, check the [[#Operators-1][Operators]] section for more details.

    Commands blocks¹ can be delimited by one of ={}=, =${}= or =&{}=, and inside them, only the
    following operators apply:
    - =>=, =>>=, =<=, =<<=.
    - =|=.
    - =?=.

    [1]: Check the [[#Commands][Commands]] section for more details.
** Constructs
*** Variables
    /Hush/ adopts static scope, and variables must be declared with a `let` statement.
    #+begin_src bash
      let x # Introduces the variable in the local scope
      let y = 5 # Shortcut for assignment
    #+end_src

    All variables are references, and therefore can refer to the same ~dict~ or ~array~ for
    instance.
*** Conditionals and loops
    In /Hush/ conditional statements don't coerce types to =bool=. This means that one cannot
    have =nil= or an empty array as conditions, like in /Lua/. All conditionals operate with a
    =bool=. If one supplies a condition that is not a boolean, a [[#Panics][panic]] occurs.

    The =if= statement can have two forms:
    #+begin_src bash
      if expression then
        # body
      end

      if expression then
        # body
      else
        # body
      end
    #+end_src
    The =if-else= form is a valid expression, and results in the value of the respective
    body. If the body ends with a statement that produces no value, then =nil= is produced.

    The =while= loop allows looping over a boolean expression:
    #+begin_src bash
      while expression do
        # body
      end
    #+end_src

    The =for= loop allows looping over an interator function:
    #+begin_src bash
      for identifier in expression do
        # body
      end
    #+end_src
    Here, a new variable is introduced (=identifier=), and =expression= must result in a
    function that can be called once for every iteration, receiving no arguments and
    returning an array with two elements. The first element *must* be a boolean. When =true=,
    the second element is assigned to the iteration variable, and the loop body is
    executed. When =false=, the iteration is finished.

    Under the hood, the =for= loop translates to something like:
    #+begin_src bash
      let _iter = expression
      let arr = _iter()
      while arr[0] do
        let identifier = arr[1]
        # body
        arr = _iter()
      end
    #+end_src

    Both loop constructs support the =break= keyword, which implements short exiting.
*** Operators
    - Field access: ::
      The index operator (=[]=) may only be applied to values of types =array= and =dict=,
      resulting in the respective associated value. [[#Panics][Panics]] when out of bounds.

      The dot access operator may only be applied to values of type =dict=, and is a
      shortcut for the index operator:
      : a.b == a["b"]
    - Logical: ::
      Logical operators may only be applied to values of type =bool=, and always result in a
      value of the same type. The =and= and =or= operators implement [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation][short circuit]] semantics.
    - Arithmetic: ::
      Arithmetic operators may be applied to numeric values (=int= and =float=). Values of
      type =int= will be automatically converted to =float= when paired with a =float= on a
      binary operator. The integer modulo operator (=%=) is only available for =int=
      values. Integer division by zero will cause a [[#Panics][panic]].
    - String: ::
      The string concatenation operator (=++=) may only be applied to strings, and will
      result in a new string. Note that strings in /Hush/ are immutable.
    - Relational: ::
      Relational operators may only be applied to values of type =int=, =float=, =char= or
      =string=, and always result in a value of type =bool=.
    - Equality: ::
      Equality operators can be applied to values of arbitrary types, and always result in
      a value of type =bool=.
    Providing invalid types for any operator will cause a [[#Panics][panic]].
*** Functions
    In traditional shells, function arguments are always strings, and the return value is
    always an integer (status code). /Hush/ proposes more generic semantics, which are
    tipically adopted by general purpose programming languages. Functions should be able
    to accept parameters of arbitrary types, and also be able to return a value of an
    arbitrary type. On the other hand, commands are limited by the operating system to
    accept strings and return a status code. Therefore, when invoking external commands,
    /Hush/ converts the given arguments to strings, and provides the status code as the
    return value.

    In /Hush/, functions:
    - Can have an arbitrary number of parameters, defined by up to two comma-separated
      lists of parameters, delimited by a semicolon. The first list, if any, denotes
      required parameters. The second list, if any, denotes optional parameters. If a
      function is called with missing required arguments, then a [[#Panics][panic]] occurs. Optional
      arguments default to ~nil~.
    - Return only one value, in contrast to /Lua/.
    - Are values, being first class citizens like every other type in the language.
    - As they are values, they have no name. A function declared with a name is actually a
      variable declaration, referring to such function value. Therefore, such variable can
      be reassigned to a different value.
    - Can also capture variables, i.e. they can be closures.
    - Can be recursive. As functions are values, recursive functions are actually closures
      on themselves.
    - Have access to a special variable, ~self~, which is a reference to the function's
      parent, if any. If a function is called directly as ~my_function()~, then ~self~ is
      ~nil~. Otherwise, if it's called as a member of a ~dict~, as in ~my_obj.my_function()~,
      then ~self~ refers to the same value as ~my_obj~.

    Summarizing, here are some examples of functions in /Hush/:
    #+begin_src bash
      # Simple function definition.
      function sum(a, b, c)
        return a + b + c
      end


      # Reassigns the sum variable, which was referring to the previous function.
      sum = function (a, b, c; d) # Here, `d` is an optional argument.
        if d != nil then
          return a + b + c + d
        else
          return a + b + c
        end
      end


      function sum(a)
        return function(b) # Closure!
          return a + b  # Here, `a` is captured from the outer scope.
        end
      end


      # Simple recursive function.
      function factorial(n)
        if n < 2 then
          return 1
        else
          return n * factorial(n - 1)
        end
      end


      # A member function.
      my_obj = @[
        value: 5,

        method: function()
          if self != nil then
            return self.value
          else
            return 0
          end
        end,
      ]

      my_obj.method() # Returns 5

      fun = my_obj.method

      fun() # Returns 0
    #+end_src
*** Expressions
    In traditional shells, expressions produce two results that can be manipulated by the
    language: the standard output (/stdin/stderr/), and a status code. The output can be
    captured by the ~$()~ operator, and the status code is immediately available through the
    ~$?~ variable.
**** Commands
     In /Hush/, command blocks are enclosed in ~{}~. Individual commands must end with a
     semicolon, except for the last command in the block. This can be annoying for simple
     commands, but it allows one to split a command across multiple lines interspersed
     with comments, which is currently impossible in /Bash/, for instance.

     #+begin_src bash
       {
         docker create
                --name $container
                -i -a STDIN -a STDOUT -a STDERR # attach all stdio
                -v $pwd:/my/project:ro # mount the source code as a read-only volume
                my-image:latest;


         rsync -av --delete --delete-excluded
                # version control directories:
                --exclude='.git/'
                --exclude='.svn/'
                # build directories:
                --exclude='.stack-work/'
                --exclude='.ccls-cache/'
                --exclude='target/'
                --exclude='bin/'
                --exclude='obj/'
                # don't backup series or torrents:
                --exclude='series/'
                --exclude='torrents/'
                ~/ /mnt/backup 2>1
           | tee rsync.log;


         list-musics
           | xargs --null -- mediainfo --Output='Audio;%Duration%\n' # get duration in miliseconds
           | awk NF # remove empty lines
           | paste -s -d + # join lines with +
           | bc # eval the resulting expression
       }
     #+end_src
***** Results and Errors
      The result of a command invocation and execution is the status code if =0=, or an
      =error= otherwise. The resulting =error= will contain the =status= field in it's
      context. In pipelines, the result is an array of the results of each individual
      command.

      The result of a command block is an array of results, or a single result if there is
      a single command/pipeline.

      By default, if a command or a pipeline produces an =error=, /Hush/ will interrupt the
      execution of the current command block. This behavior is similar to /Bash/'s ~set -e~.
      To prevent this, one can use the =?= operator after a command/pipeline, and /Hush/ will
      proceed even if the result is an =error=.

      Example:
      #+begin_src bash
        let results = {
          # (A)
          cat /etc/shadow ?; # Should error with permission denied, but won't abort the command block.

          # (B) The following pipeline will contain an error, but the command block won't be aborted.
          echo Hello world!
            | cat
            | cat /dev/shadow # Should error with permission denied.
            | cat ?;

          # (C)
          echo Hello world!; # Should succeed, resulting in 0.

          # (D) Should error, aborting the command block.
          echo Hello world!
            | cat /dev/shadow # Should error with permission denied.
            | cat;

          # (E)
          echo Foo Bar; # Won't be executed, because an error has caused the abortion of the command block.
        }

        let result

        # (A): Permission denied.
        result = results[0]
        std.type(result) == "error"
        result.status == 1 # Cat returns 1 when permission denied.

        # (B): Array containing results of each command in the pipeline.
        result = results[1]
        std.type(result) == "array"
        result[0] == 0 # Success.
        result[1] == 0 # Success.
        std.type(result[2]) == "error" # Permission denied.
        result[3] == 0 # Success.

        # (C): Success.
        result = result[2]
        result == 0

        # (D): array containing results of each command in the pipeline.
        result = result[3]
        std.type(result) == "array"
        result[0] == 0 # Success.
        std.type(result[1]) == "error" # Permission denied.
        result[2] == 0 # Success.

        # (E): Due to the previous failured not guarded by the ? operator, the last command in the
        # block didn't get to execute.
        std.length(results) == 4
      #+end_src
***** Command lookup
      If the command name contains a path separator (=/=), /Hush/ will attempt to execute the
      respective file, if any. Otherwise, /Hush/ will look up the command in the following
      order:
      1. Aliases: command aliases defined by the user.
      2. Built-in commands: commands which are not external programs, but are implemented by
         /Hush/, like =cd= and =echo=.
      3. Executables in =$PATH=, respecting the list order

      If there is no such command, or the command cannot be executed, it results in an
      =error=, and /Hush/ outputs the error description to /stderr/.
***** Arguments
      Command arguments are separated by spaces. Backslash-escaped spaces are not
      considered separators, but argument text. Variables can be accessed by prefixing
      their identifier with =$=, or surrounding with =${}=, and are expanded with the following
      rules:
      1. =nil=, =bool=, =char=, =int=, =float=, =string=: converted to string using =tostring()=, passed
         as a *single* argument, regardless of containing spaces, asterisks, and whatnot.
      2. =array=: each element will be converted to a *single* argument, using the first and
         third rules. If the array is empty, no argument is produced. This way, arrays can
         be used to programmatically build lists of command arguments.
      3. =dict=, =function=, =error=: won't be converted, causing a [[#Panics][panic]] instead.
      Attempting to access an undeclared variable results in a [[#Panics][panic]].

      Single quotes delimit literals *without* interpolation, while double quotes allow
      interpolation. Inside double quotes, variables can be accessed with =$= or =${}=, to
      allow consecutive word characters. As an example, all of the following produce a
      single argument to =echo=:
      #+begin_src bash
        let file = "/etc/myconfig"

        {
          echo $file; # /etc/myconfig

          echo '$file'; # $file
          echo '/usr'$file'uration'; # /usr/etc/myconfiguration

          echo "$file"; # /etc/myconfig
          echo "${file}"; # /etc/myconfig
          echo "/usr${file}uration"; # /usr/etc/myconfiguration
        }
      #+end_src

      In /Hush/, there is no such thing as implicitly expanding or globbing the contents of a
      variable.

      /Hush/ performs tree types of expansion for unquoted literal arguments.
      1. *Tilde expansion*:

         Any argument starting with =~/= will have such prefix expanded to =$HOME/=.
      2. *Brace expansion*:

         Arguments containing unescaped brace-enclosed lists will be expanded to an array
         of strings, regardless of existing file paths. The brace syntax allows two forms:
         - ={a,b,,'c'}=: two or more comma-separated strings, which can be empty or
           quoted. One argument will be generated for each string.
         - ={1..10}=: two integers separated by =..=, denoting a sequence. One argument will
           be generated for each element of the sequence.

         Examples:
         - =dir/file{,.jpg,'.png'}= -> =[ "dir/file", "dir/file.jpg", "dir/file.png" ]=
         - =dir/file-{3..1}.txt= -> =[ "dir/file-3.txt", "dir/file-2.txt", "dir/file-1.txt" ]=
      3. *Filename expansion*:

         Arguments containing any of the following patterns, when unescaped, will be
         expanded to an alphabetically sorted array of existing file paths, matched by the
         respective regular expression construct:
         - =*= -> =[^/]*=
         - =?= -> =[^/]=
         - =[= ... =]= -> =[= ... =]=

         Example: =some/*/path*/with/patterns/[1-9].???= will match paths with the following
         regex:
         : some/[^/]*/path[^/]*/with/patterns/[1-9].[^/][^/][^/]

         Hidden files (whose name starts with a dot) *are matched by default*, as opposed to
         /Bash/. Directory references (=.=, =..=) are not matched. Relative paths are expanded
         with a =./= prefix, in order to prevent flag injection vulnerabilities. ¹

      When the expansion results in an array, such array is converted to arguments
      according to the rules described in [[#Commands][Commands]].

      While brace and filename expansion may not be used simultaneously in the same
      argument, tilde expansion can be used with both.

      [1]: As in =chown my-user *=, when there is a file named =--reference=/home/other-user/=.

***** Redirection
      Traditional shells implement multiple operators for redirecting file descriptors. In
      /Bash/, for instance, there are [[https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Redirections.html][at least 10 such operators]], which implement quite
      specific behavior. To keep things simple, /Hush/ proposes only four redirection
      operators:
      - ~command < filename~: opens /stdin/ as a reference to the given filename.
      - ~command << string~: opens /stdin/ as a pipe containing the given string.
      - ~command fd> fd2~ or ~command fd> filename~: opens =fd= as a reference to the same file
        of =fd2=, or as a reference to the given filename. =fd= defaults to =1= (/stdout/) when
        omitted. The target file is created if it doesn't exists, or truncated otherwise.
      - ~command fd>> file~: opens =fd= as a reference to the given filename. =fd1= defaults to
        =1= (/stdout/) when omitted. The target file is created if it doesn't exists, or
        appended-to otherwise.

      Literal file descriptors are denoted by a single number, according to the following table:
      | File   | Number |
      |--------+--------|
      | /stdin/  |      0 |
      | /stdout/ |      1 |
      | /stderr/ |      2 |
      If one desires to redirect to a file named "2", quotes must be used:
      #+begin_src bash
        { command > "2" }
      #+end_src

      Filenames may be supplied through variables, but not file descriptors:
      #+begin_src bash
        let var = 2
        { command > $var } # Redirects to a file named "2"
      #+end_src

      Contrary to traditional shells, redirection operators must be placed after all of
      the supplied arguments for a command. This aims to assure that no redirection can go
      unnoticed when there are many arguments. The redirection operator has higher
      precedence than the [[#Piping][pipe]] operator.

      If any of the I/O operations regarding redirections fails, the target command is not
      executed, and an =error= is produced.
***** Piping
      Commands can be chained into pipelines using the =|= operator, which connects the left
      hand side's =stdout= to the right hand side's =stdin= using a unix [[https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009604499/functions/pipe.html][pipe]]. While the =|=
      operator is left associative, all commands in a pipeline are executed concurrently.
      /Hush/ awaits all processes to finish, producing an array with the result of all
      commands in the pipeline.

      Here are some insightful examples of such behavior:
      - The following pipeline:
        #+begin_src bash
          { ps aux | cat | cat | cat | grep 'cat' }
        #+end_src
        May output something like:
        #+begin_example
          91632  0.0  0.0   5492   676 pts/3    S+   19:03   0:00 cat
          91633  0.0  0.0   5492   680 pts/3    S+   19:03   0:00 cat
          91634  0.0  0.0   5492   684 pts/3    S+   19:03   0:00 cat
          91635  0.0  0.0   6396  2316 pts/3    S+   19:03   0:00 grep cat
        #+end_example
        Which indicates that all =cat= programs were already running when =ps= fetched the
        process list.
      - The following command outputs an infinite stream of zeroes:
        #+begin_src bash
          { cat /dev/zero | tr '\0' '0' }
        #+end_src
        But when piped to the =head= command, all involved programs terminate:
        #+begin_src bash
          { cat /dev/zero | tr '\0' '0' | head -c 20 }
        #+end_src
        Because when =head= closes it's side of the pipe, attempts to write from the other
        programs result in =SIGPIPE=.

      If any of the I/O operations regarding the pipes fails, none of the target command
      are executed, and an =error= is produced instead.
***** Capturing output
      The capture operator (~${}~ in /Hush/) adopts more flexible semantics than those of
      traditional shells. Instead of resulting in the command's /stdout/, the result is a
      ~dict~ containing three fields: a =string= for /stdout/, a =string= for /stderr/, and the
      result status. This enables acessing both /stdout/ and /stderr/ separately, as well as
      the result status, all with value semantics. If one cares only about the /stdout/ for
      instance, direct access can be used, without requiring any intermediate variables:
      #+begin_src bash
        ${date --iso-8061}.stdout
      #+end_src

      To pass the output as arguments to other commands, one needs intermediate variables,
      as opposed to traditional shells.

      /Bash/:
      #+begin_src bash
        tee $(date --iso-8601)
      #+end_src

      /Hush/:
      #+begin_src bash
        let date = ${date --iso-8601}.stdout
        { tee $date }
      #+end_src

      If any of the I/O operations regarding capturing fails, the target command is not
      executed, and an =error= is produced.
***** Asynchronous commands
      Shells like /Ksh/, /Zsh/ and /Bash/ support asynchronous commands through the =coproc=
      keyword and the =&= operator, also providing the =wait= built-in for joining such
      coprocesses. In such shells, the /pid/ of a asynchronous command is immediately
      available through the =$!= variable.

      Bash:
      #+begin_src bash
        # Array variable to capture the pids of all spawned tasks
        declare -a pids

        one long running command &
        pids+=($!)

        another long running command &
        pids+=($!)

        yet another long running command &
        pids+=($!)

        # Give jobs some time to complete
        sleep 2000

        status=0

        for pid in ${pids[@]}; do
          if ps -p $pid > /dev/null; then
            # Job is stil running, abort...
            kill $pid
            status=1
          else
            # Job finished, check if succeeded:
            if ! wait $pid; then
              status=$?
            fi
          fi
        done

        exit $status
      #+end_src

      /Hush/ proposes a different approach, allowing one to launch a command block
      asynchronously, and have immediate access to the operations regarding such job. When
      a command block is delimited with the =&{}= operator, the block is executed
      asynchronously, and the resulting value of the expression is a =dict= with a set of
      values and functions to operate on the job:
      - ~pid~: the job's =pid=. You are unlikely to need this field in practice.
      - ~running()~: returns a =bool= indicating whether the job is still running.
      - ~abort()~: aborts the job, killing any child processes.
      - ~join()~: like /Bash/'s =wait=, blocks until the job is finished, and returns the
        command block result.

      Hush:
      #+begin_src bash
        # Array variable to capture the pids of all spawned tasks
        let jobs = []

        let job = &{ one long running command }
        jobs.push(job)

        job = &{ another long running command }
        jobs.push(job)

        job = &{ yet another long running command }
        jobs.push(job)

        # Give jobs some time to complete
        std.sleep(2000)

        let status = 0

        for job in std.iter(jobs) do
          if job.running() then
            # Job is stil running, abort...
            job.abort()
            status = 1
          else
            # Job finished, check if succeeded:
            let job_result = job.join()
            if std.type(job_result) == "error" then
              std.print("Failed to execute job:")
              std.print(job_result)
            end
          end
        end
      #+end_src
**** Function calls
     Functions in /Hush/ can be called using the ~()~ operator. Like in the function
     declaration, the function call operator receives required and optional arguments,
     using the exact same syntax.
***** Redirection, capturing, piping and asynchronous execution
      In /Hush/, there is currently no way of capturing, piping or redirecting the output of
      shell functions. This is due to the fact that pipes in particular have concurrent
      semantics, i.e., each component (command or function) in the pipeline runs
      concurrently. This would be problematic for /Hush/ functions because they can reference
      outter variables through parameters and closures, and consequently mutate their
      values. Therefore, two functions in a pipeline could access the same variable
      concurrently, potentially causing a data race.

      There are plans to include such features in the future, by the means of cloning all
      parameters and closures to piped and asynchronous functions, therefore inhibiting
      data races. But this has to be more carefully designed before we can settle for
      anything.
** Errors
   /Hush/ provides two mechanisms for errors. The =error= type allows one to construct and
   manipulate *recoverable* errors, which can be detected and handled. Panics, on the other
   hand, are *irrecoverable* errors, which result in abortion of the current script
   execution.
*** Recoverable errors
    /Hush/ provides the =error= built-in function to construct values of the =error= type. This
    mechanism should be used for reporting and handling errors. Command blocks and
    built-in functions will report errors by returning values of such type, instead of the
    expected return value.
    #+begin_src bash
      let result = std.cd("/non-existing/directory")

      if std.type(result) == "error" then
         std.print("Failed to change directory:")
         std.print(result)
      end
    #+end_src

    The =error= built-in will produce an =error= providing:
    - A message, supplied by the caller.
    - An optional context, supplied by the caller. Useful for attaching related data.
    - An automatically generated backtrace.

    Examples of recoverable errors:
    - =file not found=
    - =permission error=
    - =invalid format=
    - =command not found=
    - =command returned non-zero exit status=
*** Panics
    Panics are *irrecoverable* errors, due to invalid program logic. When a panic occurs,
    /Hush/ halts the current script execution, and prints an error description message along
    with a stack trace to /stderr/.

    Examples of errors that cause a panic:
    - =syntax error=
    - =integer division by zero=
    - =index out of bounds=
    - =attempt to call a value that is not a function=
    - =missing mandatory arguments=
** Built-ins
   /Hush/ provides built-in functions for common tasks, and built-in commands for tasks that
   cannot be performed by external commands.
*** Functions
    /Hush/ provides a top-level =dict= named =std=, which contains all built-in functions:
    - =cd(dir)= ::
      If =dir= is a =string=, attempts to change the shell's current working directory,
      returning an error on failure. [[#Panics][Panics]] otherwise. This functionality is also avaiable
      through the =cd= [[#Commands-1][command]].
    - =error(description; context)= ::
      Returns a value of type =error=, containing the given description, a backtrace, and
      the optional context. If =description= is not a =string=, or =context= is not =nil= or a
      =dict=, then a [[#Panics][panic]] occurs.
    - =exit(status)= ::
      If =status= is an =int=, exits the shell, returning the given status to the operating
      system. [[#Panics][Panics]] otherwise.
    - ~glob(value)~ ::
      If =value= is a string, performs path expansion, producing a possibly empty array of
      strings. [[#Panics][Panics]] otherwise.
    - ~iter(value)~ ::
      If =value= is a =string=, =array= or =dict=, returns a function that iterates through it's
      elements. [[#Panics][Panics]] otherwise. See the [[#Conditionals-and-loops][Conditionals and loops]] section for more details
      on iterator functions.
    - ~length(value)~ ::
      If =value= is a =string=, =array= or =dict=, returns the number of elements. [[#Panics][Panics]]
      otherwise.
    - ~print(; value)~ ::
      If =value= is not =nil=, converts it to string using =tostring=, then writes to =stdout=,
      followed by a line break. Prints an empty string otherwise.
    - =sleep(miliseconds)= ::
      If =miliseconds= is an =int=, sleeps for the given duration. [[#Panics][Panics]] otherwise.
    - ~tostring(value)~ ::
      Converts =value= to string, using the following rules:
      + =nil=, =bool=, =char=, =int=, =float=, =string=: traditional representation, without quotes.
      + =function=: returns "<function>".
      + =array=, =dict=: recursively dump the inner values, delimited with the respective
        literal syntax.
      + =error=: formats the error description message, along with the context if any.
    - =type(value)= ::
      Returns a string describing the type of =value=.
      #+begin_src bash
        let val = "this is a string"
        std.type(val) == "string" # true
      #+end_src

    Attempts to change the values of the =std= =dict= result in undefined behavior.
*** Commands
    /Hush/ provides only a handful built-in commands, which provide functionality that is
    impossible to be implemented by external programs:
    - =alias= ::
      Creates an alias, to take part in [[#Command-lookup][command lookup]]. The first argument is the alias
      name, and the following arguments are the aliased command and arguments. The alias
      name cannot contain a path separator (=/=). Example:
      #+begin_src bash
        { alias ll ls --color=auto -lh --time-style long-iso --group-directories-first }
      #+end_src
    - =cd= ::
      The first and only argument is the directory to be accessed. If the directory does
      not exists, or cannot be accessed, =cd= prints an error description to /stderr/, and
      returns =1=. Example:
      #+begin_src bash
        { cd /home/my-username/ }
      #+end_src

    Note that both the =alias= and =cd= built-ins perform side-effects in the shell's
    execution context, and therefore cannot be used in concurrent constructs, such as
    [[#Piping][piping]] and [[#Asynchronous-commands][asynchronous commands]]. They also can't take part in [[#Redirection][redirection]] and
    [[#Capturing-output][capturing]]. Attempts to use built-in commands with any of these constructs will result
    in a [[#Panics][panic]].
** Object model
   /Hush/ mainly focuses on functional programming, but also supports some sort of object
   oriented programming. While /Lua/ proposes the /metatable/ mechanism to add sofisticated dynamics
   to /tables/, /Hush/ adopts simpler semantics, having /dicts/ as plain key-value stores.

   Functions can act as methods by using the ~self~ operator, as described
   previously. Objects can be defined as /dicts/ with member functions, which can be defined
   by a constructor function.

   Hush:
   #+begin_src bash
     function MyCounter(initial_value) # MyCounter is a function that represents a Class.
       let increment = function()
         self._value += 1
       end

       let get = function()
         return self._value
       end

       return @[
         _value: initial_value, # Public field.
         # These methods could be implemented here as well.
         # Remeber, functions are nothing but values.
         increment: increment, # Method
         get: get,             # Method
       ]
     end


     let counter = MyCounter(0)
     counter.increment()
     counter.increment()
     counter.get() # Returns 2


     function StepCounter(initial_value, step)
       # This function captures the `step` variable, which acts as a private field.
       let increment = function()
         self._value += step
       end

       let print = function()
         std.print(self.get())
       end

       let counter = MyCounter(initial_value) # Inheritance
       counter.print = print # Additional method
       counter.increment = increment # Method overriding
       return counter
     end


     let counter = StepCounter(0, 2)
     counter.increment()
     counter.increment()
     counter.print() # Prints 4
   #+end_src
